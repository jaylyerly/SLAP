[ShelterLuv](https://www.shelterluv.com) Adoptable Pets (S.L.A.P) for iOS

This app connects to the ShelterLuv API and displays animals that are "published" by the API. API docs are [available](https://help.shelterluv.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000580127-Shelterluv-API-Overview) but they require a ShelterLuv login.

The app needs an API key access the API. Once you get an API key from the ShelterLuv dashboard, put it in a `.env` file in the top level project directory (in the same folder as the Xcode project file). See the `.env.template` file for the format.
