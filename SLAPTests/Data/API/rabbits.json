      "Description": "Bella is a sweet, lop-eared rabbit, about three years old. She came to Triangle Rabbits from one of the local area shelters when she was pregnant with a litter of babies. Those babies are grown and have been adopted, and now Bella is ready to find her forever home. Bella likes chewing paper bags and also exploring inside them, and gets very excited when food comes out. She is shy and learning to like humans. She likes for people to ask before touching her so she does not get startled. Once she realizes pets are being offered, she likes to have her ears stroked and be rubbed on the back. She would love a home with a new friend for company. Currently fostering in the Raleigh-Durham area.",

      "Description": "Meet Honey & Juniper! These two sisters are about 7 months old and must be adopted together. They may be small, but they need a lot of space to play and more importantly, to get away from each other when they want some alone time. They are currently living in a 10x11 bunny proofed room, but if they could talk, they would probably say they could use a little more square footage. They love to munch on hay all day long, but in the morning they circle like sharks for pellets. They also enjoy eating veggies twice a day. They are still pretty shy, but they will warm up to you if you give them time. They are also quite active and would prefer to run around than be pet. They make great bunny entertainment AKA bunny TV! Currently fostering in the Charlotte area.",

Her favorite treat is banana (though, really, all treats are nice). She is good with her litter box, and enjoys re-arranging her hay to her liking (FYI, she says it goes in the front!). She is curious about the other bunnies sin her foster home, but seems happier in her space and doesn't venture too far. She is currently fostering in the Wilmington area.",

He will contentedly do construction all day on them. When left alone too long he will also move all of his furniture around. He can be very curious and then does some firm nudging!

He loves to boop his jingle ball toy with his nose and observe from the top of his cottage. Hermey also loves his fuzzy bed and will snuggle into it for a snooze. He's a great hay eater and has a big appetite. He is doing well learning the litter box and mostly keeps everything in the box now. He would be a great companion for someone who can give a lot of attention, and he may do well with a bunny friend! He is currently fostering in the Raleigh-Durham area.",

She is healed and ready for a home of her own. Her hip will continue to solidify the false joint for several more months, but she doesn't need to wait until then to be adopted and we're so excited for her! Opal is very nosy and into everything. If she even *thinks* you have food in your hand she closes her eyes, opens her mouth, and goes in for the bite - hilarious! She like sto explore and is curious about everything, but when it comes down to it she loves a good head rub the most. Her mobility is great; she is still building up strength in her surgery leg. Opal is about 2 years old, spayed and vaccinated for RHDV2. She is currently fostering in the Raleigh-Durham, NC area.",

      "Description": "Holly came to rescue with her eight tiny babies in December 2022. Now her little ones are teenagers and Holly is ready for a home of her own. She LOVES pets and is not shy about demanding people's attention. She enjoys going on adventures and likes to have lots of room to explore (bunny proofing is a must, as she also likes to climb). She does not like being enclosed and is happiest when she gets lots of exercise time. She is good with gentle children. She does not like her cat roommate and doesn't seem to like other rabbits, so would be best as a single bunny. Holly is about two years old, spayed, vaccinated for RHDV2, and is currently fostering in the Raleigh-Durham area.",

She is curious about the cat and gentle dog in her foster home and will sniff them through the gate. She loves running around, exploring, and chewing everything. Dancer enjoys hanging out in her hidey houses when it's time to relax. She has a great appetite and will try anything, but romaine, basil and cilantro are favorites. She is also an escape artist and has jumped a lower 24-inch x-pen so a taller enclosure would be best for her. She is spayed, vaccinated, and ready for a home of her own.

She seems to gain confidence from being near other bunnies and may benefit from having a friend. She's not really into pets, but does enjoy quietly exploring and decorating her cardboard houses. She would be best in a quiet home where she can feel settled and enjoy some bunny zen. She is about seven months old, spayed, and vaccinated for RHDV2. Currently fostering in the Raleigh-Durham, NC area.",

His foster family adores the way he greets them when it's breakfast/dinner time and how he dances across the carpet. He loves to hop up on people when they lay on the floor with him. Benji is very good at using his litter box. He's not a big chewer and leaves alone most things he shouldn't be nibbling, though he does have a taste for shoes. He has proven wonderful with kids in his foster home and would be an amazing addition to any family. Benji is about 1.5 years old, neutered, and vaccinated for RHDV2. He is currently fostering in the Wilmington, NC area.",

      "Description": "Sasha is a model house rabbit - she is happy to help make the bed, fluff the pillows, and clean the furniture (if licking it counts)! She loves digging in blankets and pillows, but is careful not to chew or tear them up. She has perfect litter box habits and is very food and treat motivated. She is lower to medium energy level and will offer some small zoomies and binkies, but usually very happy to lounge around. She is more on the independent side but is very curious and will hop up and honk at humans when they come into her room. She's very talkative! She likes being pet, but is not a snuggle bun and needs a human who can respect her space. So far her favorite toy other than blankets has been plain brown packing paper. She also loves having a stuffed animal in her pen and grooms it often. She may be interested in a friend, or may only prefer stuffed animal friends that follow her rules. Sasha is about six years old, spayed, and vaccinated. She is fostering in the Raleigh-Durham area.",

Sandy will tolerate pets but will demand food at the same time. She will jump on your lap for treats and attention, so get ready! Both are very food motivated and will come running when called or when the food bag/jar opens. They are both curious buns who love to explore and prefer to be in a home that offers free roaming options. This is when they show off their real skills with their binkies and zooming. They are working on their improving their litter training, and do better in a bigger space with multiple litter boxes. They love chewing on cardboard and exploring tunnels and hidey spaces. Both Winnie and Sandy are spayed, vaccinated for RHDV2, and ready to find their forever home! They are currently being fostered in the Raleigh-Durham area.",

She's not too much of an explorer! She's pretty content to sit on something soft and chill out most of the time. Her favorite treats are dried strawberries and fresh blueberries;\nshe eats most greens and veggies, but her favorites are spinach, arugula, and carrots. Bijou is a little explorer! She loves to investigate new things and spaces in her room, and just recently she's learned about jumping up on the bed and hanging out there! She is still learning to accept pets from humans, but has made a lot of progress; she's much more high-energy and playful than her mom Petra. She loves to chew, so plenty of toys are a must for this girl. Bijou prefers hay and pellets over greens. Her favorite treat is dried strawberries.

He's very outgoing and loves exploring his space (and your space, and possibly your neighbor's space). He loves to jump, so a tall enclosure or an enclosure with a roof would be best for him. He enjoys attention and is not shy about climbing on laps for pets. He was good with the cat in his foster home. Chew toys are his favorites, so plenty of those please! Dug is about two years old, neutered, and vaccinated for RHDV2. He's ready for his next adventure! Currently fostering in the Raleigh-Durham, NC area. ",

He has bloomed in foster care! He has learned how to binky, tooth chatter and to beg for food. He's full of personality and love. His favorite past time is playing with his chew and toss toys. Lebowski is very good with his liter habits and there's not a veggie or fruit he will turn down. He is about two years old, neutered, vaccinated, and ready for a family to love. Currently fostering in the Wilmington, NC area.",

      "Description": "Meet Mumford. Mumford is a tidy and well-behaved bun who is very shy around humans. He is slowly opening up and showing off his binkies for his foster mom, and we think that another bunny friend would help him gain confidence and come out of his shell. Mumford seems interested in other rabbits, but can be reactive and needs a calmer friend. Mumford enjoys having tunnels and boxes to nap in and likes to play hide and seek in the curtains in his foster room. He is great while free-roaming and displays no destructive tendencies in his foster home. He is very timid and shy fellow, and is looking for a family with lots of love, patience, and treats to build trust. He doesn't eat much salad, but loves Science Selective loops and dried strawberry. Mumford is estimated to be 1-2 years old, neutered, vaccinated and ready for a family. Currently fostering in the Raleigh-Durham, NC area.",

Wednesday loves any and all toys you give her. She also enjoys begging for treats (her favorites are broccoli, basil, dill, and banana chips). Once she gets to know you she will ask for nose pets and will fall asleep if you stroke her nose to her ears for long enough. She's very smart and super playful and likes to show off her acrobatic skills with lots of binkies - she LOVES to free roam. After playtime she enjoys relaxing on the couch. She has done well in a home with adults and gentle children, however she does easily startle and is very shy with strangers at first so may be best in a quieter home. She is estimated to be 2-3 years old, and is spayed, vaccinated, and ready for her forever home. She is currently fostering in the Raleigh-Durham, NC area. ",

She is shy and quite easily startled by unexpected noises or fast movements so would be best in a quiet home. She enjoys company and will tend to loaf nearby on the carpet when her foster family is working, but prefers to be petted at her own pace. She likes the space to free roam very much, and expresses her appreciation with zoomies. She doesn't seem to be a picky eater and always clears her plates of greens: dandelion greens, red leaf lettuce, and green leaf lettuce are favorites. She is also a big fan of apple treats. For toys/enrichment, she absolutely loves willow baskets, palm bowls, and apple sticks. She also had lots of fun with a toy box stuffed with orchard hay. She loves simple cardboard boxes, preferring her hidey houses to be sturdy. She is about 1.5 years old, spayed, vaccinated, and ready for a home of her own. Currently fostering in the Raleigh-Durham, NC area.",

      "Description": "Maple is a very sweet bunny. He likes exploring the house when he first gets out of his pen and then he will settle down for a rest. He's quite clean and often grooms his fabulous hair. He will need frequent grooming to keep his beautiful coat in good condition. He likes to visit his foster mom while they watch TV and nudge for attention. He also likes to jump up on the couch - climbing is fun! He will climb on tables and shelves to see what is up there so beware! Bunny proofing beyond the floor is a must for this fellow. His favorite treats are apple, banana chips, and carrot. He eats lots of hay and enjoys all his salads. For toys he loves cardboard toys, paper, and palm leaf plates. He has good litter box habits. He is neutered, vaccinated, and ready for home of his own. Currently fostering in the Raleigh-Durham area.",

Snickers is very chill overall, but does sometimes startle (usually because his brother is full of drama). He loves to run and play but is not very adventurous with his exploring. He will tolerate pets and grooming (grooming is a must with his long fur!). He is still a little suspicious of greens and new foods but will eventually try them. Spirit startles easily but is very curious and likes to investigate visitors and situations. He is very adventurous and loves to get into trouble chewing and digging. Like his brother, he is skeptical of new foods and treats. He loves toys and can bunstruct toys in a single day. He likes gentle pets once he gets to know you.

She is currently around 6 months old, spayed, excellent with her litter box, and ready for her forever family.

      "Description": "Meet Cookies! This little guy had a rough start. He was found stray, hopping by the side of the road, and was picked up in a dog's mouth. He also had a lot of fur missing from his feet and tail, possibly from urine burns from a rarely cleaned living space. Cookies has done a lot of healing since coming to rescue in March. He's grown back his fur and now this adolescent rabbit loves to run about his foster home at top speed or hop all over, including onto chairs. He loves showing off his binky and racing skills! He's been known to climb furniture and unplug things while chewing on the cord protector (so bunny proofing for the marauding rabbit is a must!). He is getting more comfortable with being pet but doesn't like to snuggle - he has things to do! He is very food motivated, so it's easy to get him in his pen with pellets or salad instead of lifting him. He will gladly hop into his carrier, but expects yummy food there! He is an entertaining and bossy bunny, making his foster family laugh at salad time by snatching his favorite pieces. Picture a tiny rabbit bounding away, head and tail held high, with a piece of kale so big he can barely hold it off the ground! He does still tend to nip stray things like seams in jeans and an errant human standing where he needs to run. He would like a home with lots of bunny proofed room to roam and humans who love him and appreciate his spunk. He is neutered and vaccinated. Currently fostering in the Raleigh-Durham area.",

She loves to play with her toys, including stacking cups, cardboard rolls, willow balls, and straw hats (hats are the best!). She's into parkour and can jump her ex-pen when she's motivated enough, so an enclosure with a top would be best. After her workout, she likes to do a spot of remodeling in her cardboard boxes and grass tunnels to go for the shredded look. Cocoa is into health food and enjoys cilantro, parsley, romaine, and kale in her salads. She prefers to graze on her pellets and hay. She's very friendly and likes attention, following her foster family around the living room and then jumping up on the couch for pats. She's a little wary of strangers, but once she gets to know them she's ready for treats. Cocoa is great with her litter box and does great during her play time. If you're looking for an active bun who likes to snuggle she might be your perfect match! Currently fostering in the Raleigh-Durham area.",

I love sniffing my foster humans but I'm not a fan of snuggles or being picked up. However, I'll let you pet me while I eat my pellets in the morning and my salad at dinner. A few of my favorites are lavender, basil, sage, and yarrow! I know my schedule well! My human thinks I'm pretty smart and catch on to things quickly. I'm always trying to run out my door to explore and find something to chew on. For that reason, if I'm free roam the room will need to be bunny-proofed. I keep a tidy home and keep myself looking my best. I am my happiest when I have the space to run! I am spayed and vaccinated. Currently fostering in the Raleigh, Durham area. ",
